# NodeJs

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. 


## Installation

1. Clone this back-end in your local: https://github.com/JulyTatiana/back-end-tags
2. Install nodejs in the IDE where you want to execute this front-end, with the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```javascript React
npm run dev
```
You will get something like this:

```
> todo-app-front@0.0.0 dev
> vite


  vite v2.9.9 dev server running at:

  > Local: http://localhost:3000/
  > Network: use `--host` to expose

  ready in 747ms.
```
Copy that URL and paste it on your preferred browser and you will be ready to use the app.
